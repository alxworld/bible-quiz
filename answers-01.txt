XIII   PUPROSE OF MISSIONARIES' JOURNEY


1. Philip

Acts 8:4,5 - Philip went to Samaria city to preach the word to gentiles and the people heed by seeing & hearing the miracles done by him. And many got baptised.

Acts 8:26-39 - Angel of the Lord spoke to Philip to go down to Gaza from Jerusalem and go near a chariot. 
Main purpose of this journey is to preach to a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship. This man belived and got baptised by Philip



2. Peter

Acts 8:14-17 =>  Peter & John were sent to Samaria, when the apostles heard that the people in Samaria received word of God. Their main purpose was to pray for them to receive the Holy Spirit, as they have only got baptised in the name  of Lord Jesus. 

Acts 9:32 =>  Peter went to Lydda to make many people turn to the Lord. He healed Aeneas there.

Acts 9:40 =>  In Joppa, Peter raised Tabitha to rise from death and that caused many people to believe in Jesus. 

Acts 10:1 => Peter went to Caesarea based on the vision of vessel that had great sheet knit at the four corners descending from heaven. Lord used Peter to baptise Cornelius and his family there. 


3. Barnabas & John Mark

Acts 15:39 => Due to contention between Paul & Barnabas, they departed one from the other: and so Barnabas took John Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus. And Paul went with Silas to Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
The main purpose is that Barnabas was always accepting and encouraging the people and Barnabas accepted John Mark (when he returned), and John Mark was later helpful in the mission work too [2 Timothy 4:11]. 


4. Paul, Silas, Timothy, Luke

Paul's second missonary journey started in Antioch in Syria with Silas and later with Timothy. They traveled overland through Asia Minor to Troas, where a vision of a Macedonian man prompted him to sail to Europe. He visited cities in Macedonia and Greece, including Philippi, Thessalonica, and Corinth. 
They had the first Christian convert in Europe with Lydia in Philippi. They established churches in Europe and returned to Antioch. [Acts 15-18]

(Timothy joined the journey in Acts 16:1-3.)

Another missionary journey by Paul reported in Acts 15:

Acts 15:1-20 => Since few men from Judea taught the brothers to be circumised to be saved. This created a big conflict between these men and Paul & Barnabas. So Paul & Barnabas went to the apostles in Jerusalem and explained the issue. 
Now Peter, James and other apostles have decided to write to those brothers that circumision is not required and  they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.
Above is the purpose of their journey.



5. Apollos


Acts 18:24-26 => Apollos first arrived in Ephesus, where he was a bold preacher but only knew of John's baptism. After being instructed more fully by Aquila and Priscilla, who corrected his understanding of the gospel, 

Acts 18:27,28 => Then he traveled to Corinth (in Achaia) where he greatly strengthened the church. He powerfully debated Jews in public, using the Scriptures to prove that Jesus is the Christ. 



XIV   ANSWER IN BRIEF

1. Distinguishing mark or sign of Paul in every epistle

[i] The distinguishing mark of Paul in his epistles is his personal handwriting, which he used to sign the closing greeting in his own hand. He used this signature to authenticate the letter, as he would typically dictate his letters to a scribe. This practice is mentioned in verses like 2 Thessalonians 3:17, 1 Corinthians 16:21, and Colossians 4:18.

[ii] His favourite doxology used across his epistles : "Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ." 

[iii] Even though, he is one of greatest apostles with so many revelations from Jesus, he used to address himself as a servant of Jesus Christ [Philippians 1:1]. 



2. Explaination of a vine bearing much fruit. 

In John 15, Jesus uses a vineyard metaphor where He is the vine, believers are branches, and God is the gardener who prunes them for growth. Believers must remain connected to Christ to bear spiritual fruit—qualities like love, joy, and peace, along with actions that honor God. This fruitfulness glorifies God the Father and demonstrates true discipleship, as believers are entirely dependent on Christ for spiritual life and productivity.


3. Undefiled religion before God

James 1:27 verse defines genuine faith as having two key components: 
[i] Active compassion (caring for the vulnerable—orphans and widows in their distress) 
[ii] Personal holiness (keeping oneself unstained by worldly corruption). 
True religion, according to James, isn't just about religious rituals but about practical love for those in need combined with moral integrity and resistance to sinful influences.


4. Primary Purposes Why God answered Elijah after verse 38

God answered Elijah after verse 38 because he wanted to demonstrate His power to the Israelites, prove that He is the one true God, and turn their hearts back to Him. This act was a direct response to Elijah's prayer, which asked God to reveal Himself so that "this people may know that You, O LORD, are GOD, and that You have turned their hearts back". The fire consuming the altar, wood, stones, and water served as a dramatic and irrefutable sign of God's power in contrast to the powerlessness of the prophets of Baal. 


5. Quote "Expect great things from God; Attempt great for God"

This is the well-known motto of William Carey (1761–1834), an English shoemaker who became a pivotal figure in the Protestant missionary movement and is often called the "Father of Modern Missions".

The quote suggests that recognizing God's greatness and potential leads to a life of committed action. By expecting great things from a great God, individuals are inspired to attempt seemingly impossible tasks, trusting that He will work through them to accomplish His will. The ultimate goal is to glorify God and advance His purposes in the world.
