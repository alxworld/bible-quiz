XIII   PUPROSE OF MISSIONARIES' JOURNEY


1. Philip

Acts 8:4,5 - Philip went to Samaria city to preach the word to gentiles and the people heed by seeing & hearing the miracles done by him. And many got baptised.

Acts 8:26-39 - Angel of the Lord spoke to Philip to go down to Gaza from Jerusalem and go near a chariot. 
Main purpose of this journey is to preach to a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship. This man belived and got baptised by Philip



2. Peter

Acts 8:14-17 =>  Peter & John were sent to Samaria, when the apostles heard that the people in Samaria received word of God. Their main purpose was to pray for them to receive the Holy Spirit, as they have only got baptised in the name  of Lord Jesus. 

Acts 9:32 =>  Peter went to Lydda to make many people turn to the Lord. He healed Aeneas there.

Acts 9:40 =>  In Joppa, Peter raised Tabitha to rise from death and that caused many people to believe in Jesus. 

Acts 10:1 => Peter went to Caesarea based on the vision of vessel that had great sheet knit at the four corners descending from heaven. Lord used Peter to baptise Cornelius and his family there. 


3. Barnabas & John Mark

Acts 15:39 => Due to contention between Paul & Barnabas, they departed one from the other: and so Barnabas took John Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus. And Paul went with Silas to Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
The main purpose is that Barnabas was always accepting and encouraging the people and Barnabas accepted John Mark (when he returned), and John Mark was later helpful in the mission work too [2 Timothy 4:11]. 


4. Paul, Silas, Timothy, Luke

Paul's second missonary journey started in Antioch in Syria with Silas and later with Timothy. They traveled overland through Asia Minor to Troas, where a vision of a Macedonian man prompted him to sail to Europe. He visited cities in Macedonia and Greece, including Philippi, Thessalonica, and Corinth. 
They had the first Christian convert in Europe with Lydia in Philippi. They established churches in Europe and returned to Antioch. [Acts 15-18]

(Timothy joined the journey in Acts 16:1-3.)

Another missionary journey by Paul reported in Acts 15:

Acts 15:1-20 => Since few men from Judea taught the brothers to be circumised to be saved. This created a big conflict between these men and Paul & Barnabas. So Paul & Barnabas went to the apostles in Jerusalem and explained the issue. 
Now Peter, James and other apostles have decided to write to those brothers that circumision is not required and  they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.
Above is the purpose of their journey.



5. Apollos


Acts 18:24-26 => Apollos first arrived in Ephesus, where he was a bold preacher but only knew of John's baptism. After being instructed more fully by Aquila and Priscilla, who corrected his understanding of the gospel, 

Acts 18:27,28 => Then he traveled to Corinth (in Achaia) where he greatly strengthened the church. He powerfully debated Jews in public, using the Scriptures to prove that Jesus is the Christ. 



XIV   ANSWER IN BRIEF

1. Distinguishing mark or sign of Paul in every epistle

[i] The distinguishing mark of Paul in his epistles is his personal handwriting, which he used to sign the closing greeting in his own hand. He used this signature to authenticate the letter, as he would typically dictate his letters to a scribe. This practice is mentioned in verses like 2 Thessalonians 3:17, 1 Corinthians 16:21, and Colossians 4:18.

[ii] His favourite doxology used across his epistles : "Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ." 

[iii] Even though, he is one of greatest apostles with so many revelations from Jesus, he used to address himself as a servant of Jesus Christ [Philippians 1:1]. 



2. Explaination of a vine bearing much fruit. 

In John 15, Jesus uses a vineyard metaphor where He is the vine, believers are branches, and God is the gardener who prunes them for growth. Believers must remain connected to Christ to bear spiritual fruit—qualities like love, joy, and peace, along with actions that honor God. This fruitfulness glorifies God the Father and demonstrates true discipleship, as believers are entirely dependent on Christ for spiritual life and productivity.


3. Undefiled religion before God

James 1:27 verse defines genuine faith as having two key components: 
[i] Active compassion (caring for the vulnerable—orphans and widows in their distress) 
[ii] Personal holiness (keeping oneself unstained by worldly corruption). 
True religion, according to James, isn't just about religious rituals but about practical love for those in need combined with moral integrity and resistance to sinful influences.


4. Primary Purposes Why God answered Elijah after verse 38

God answered Elijah after verse 38 because he wanted to demonstrate His power to the Israelites, prove that He is the one true God, and turn their hearts back to Him. This act was a direct response to Elijah's prayer, which asked God to reveal Himself so that "this people may know that You, O LORD, are GOD, and that You have turned their hearts back". The fire consuming the altar, wood, stones, and water served as a dramatic and irrefutable sign of God's power in contrast to the powerlessness of the prophets of Baal. 


5. Quote "Expect great things from God; Attempt great for God"

This is the well-known motto of William Carey (1761–1834), an English shoemaker who became a pivotal figure in the Protestant missionary movement and is often called the "Father of Modern Missions".

The quote suggests that recognizing God's greatness and potential leads to a life of committed action. By expecting great things from a great God, individuals are inspired to attempt seemingly impossible tasks, trusting that He will work through them to accomplish His will. The ultimate goal is to glorify God and advance His purposes in the world. 



XV    ANSWER IN DETAIL


1. Stephen's Martyrdom vs Charlie Kirk's Martyrdom
==================================================

Stephen's Martyrdom
Stephen became the first Christian martyr, dying while praying for forgiveness for his killers—mirroring Jesus’s own words on the cross. [Acts 7:59]

By-products of this Martyrdom
[i] Exposed resistance: Stephen's bold speech exposed persistent resistance to God among the Jewish leaders and their culpability in Jesus’s death, which further enraged the authorities.
[ii] Spread of Gospel: The church’s members were forced to scatter to Judea and Samaria, turning a crisis into a catalyst for missionary work—fulfilling Jesus’s command that the gospel be carried beyond Jerusalem. [Acts 11:19]
[iii] Paul's Conversion: The example of Stephen's forgiveness and faithfulness under fire deeply impacted witnesses—most notably Paul, who observed and later became a leading Christian missionary after his conversion. [Acts 22:20]
[iv] Encouragement to the believers: Early Christians found encouragement and inspiration from Stephen’s willingness to suffer and forgive, helping to define Christian identity as loving, forgiving, and steadfast under persecution. [Acts 8:2]

Charlie Kirk's Martyrdom
[i] Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot and killed on September 10, 2025, during a public debate event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. 
[ii] His death is widely described as martyrdom in conservative circles, attributed to his vocal advocacy for free speech and conservative values, and has left a lasting mark on American political life. 

Similar Patterns 
[i] Boldness in public => Declaring faith-based convictions and their resilience in the face of hostility and criticism, leading to both being described as "martyrs" for their respective causes. [Acts 6:9]
[ii] Service and Compassion => Both individuals devoted themselves to serving others, with Stephen ministering to widows in the early church and Charlie Kirk mentoring and guiding young people, offering them purpose and a sense of community. Their actions reflected a compassionate approach rooted in faith and a desire to help those marginalized or in need. [Acts 6:8]
[iii] Public Witness and Opposition => 
Stephen was known for his bold testimony about Christianity [Acts 7:51], which provoked intense opposition and eventually led to his being stoned by those who rejected his message [Acts 7:59]. 
Charlie Kirk, while working in a modern political and media landscape, similarly faced fierce criticism, both online and in person, for openly declaring his faith and right-wing perspectives, culminating in violent opposition and his death. Both stood firm in their convictions, even when threatened with violence.
[iv] Christlike Forgiveness => 
Stephen's defining moment was his prayer of forgiveness for his executioners, as recounted in Acts 7:60, mirroring Christ's own example. Charlie Kirk is described as seeking to embody grace and truth in his interactions, aspiring to respond to opponents without hatred and emphasizing forgiveness as a core strength rooted in faith. This pursuit of reconciliation over retaliation marks a key pattern in their stories.
[v] Impact and Legacy => 
The deaths of both Stephen and Charlie Kirk have been framed as powerful testimonies to their beliefs, inspiring those who agreed with their messages to continue standing for what they saw as truth, even at great personal cost. Their patterns of bold faith, service, and forgiveness have been highlighted as models for others to emulate in similar social, cultural, or spiritual struggles.

Summary
Both Stephen and Charlie Kirk demonstrate patterns of outspoken faith, compassion in service, resilience against opposition, and forgiveness, making their lives and legacies subjects of frequent comparison in contemporary religious and political thought.

3. 

Jesus refer to Himself 

In the Gospel of John, Jesus frequently refers to Himself using the phrase "I am," which is significant because it echoes the divine name revealed to Moses in Exodus 3:14 ("I AM WHO I AM") and signals Jesus' claim to divinity. There are seven major metaphorical "I am" statements in John, each revealing something important about Jesus' character and mission


The Seven "I Am" Statements

"I am the bread of life" (John 6:35, 48, 51).
"I am the light of the world" (John 8:12; 9:5).
"I am the door" (John 10:7, 9).
"I am the good shepherd" (John 10:11, 14).
"I am the resurrection and the life" (John 11:25).
"I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6).
"I am the true vine" (John 15:1, 5)

Each statement is paired with a miracle or teaching that illustrates Jesus' unique role and mission, and together they form one of the key theological threads of John's gospel.


"I Am" as a Direct Declaration

Jesus also uses "I am" as a direct declaration of His divinity:
[i] When challenged by religious leaders, He says, "before Abraham was born, I am!" (John 8:58). This was understood as a clear claim to deity, prompting the Jews to attempt to stone Him.
[ii] When arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane, He identifies Himself by simply saying "I am he," causing those who came to arrest Him to fall back (John 18:4-6).


The Seven "I AM" Statements in John's Gospel

1. "I am the bread of life" (John 6:35, 41, 48, 51)

Declared after feeding the 5,000
Contrasted with manna Moses provided in the wilderness
Offers eternal life versus physical sustenance

2. "I am the light of the world" (John 8:12; 9:5)

Stated before healing a man born blind
Demonstrated through giving sight
Echoes God's creation of light in Genesis 1:3

3. "I am the door" (John 10:7, 9)

Uses sheepfold imagery
Emphasizes Jesus as the only entry point to God's kingdom
No alternative path exists

4. "I am the good shepherd" (John 10:11, 14)

Shows Jesus' protective love for His followers
Willing to die for the flock
Claims a title used for God in Psalm 23:1

5. "I am the resurrection and the life" (John 11:25)

Spoken before raising Lazarus from death
Demonstrates power over death itself
Holds "the keys of death and the grave"

6. "I am the way and the truth and the life" (John 14:6)

Jesus is the exclusive path to God
Confirms His identity as the Word of God
The sole source of eternal life

7. "I am the true vine" (John 15:1, 5)

Believers are branches; Christ is the vine
Emphasizes dependence on Christ for spiritual fruitfulness
Separation from Christ results in no fruit

Common Pattern
Jesus backs each statement with corresponding actions, demonstrating His claims through miracles and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.
​


4. God harden Pharaoh's heart


God is described as hardening Pharaoh's heart 19 times in the book of Exodus, depending on how the passages are counted and interpreted. Specifically:

[i] God explicitly says He will harden Pharaoh's heart four times (Exodus 4:21; 7:3; 14:4, 14:17).

[ii] The text explicitly states 15 times that God hardens Pharaoh's heart during the plagues (Exodus 9:12; 10:1, 10:20, 10:27; 11:10; 14:8).

God's action of hardening is highlighted more frequently in the later plagues, after Pharaoh himself had already hardened his heart multiple times. This theme underscores both divine sovereignty and Pharaoh's persistent resistance.


Verses mentioned


Exodus 4:21
And the Lord said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.

Exodus 14:8
And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.

Exodus 14:17
And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.



Reasons for hardening Pharaoh’s heart

To Display His Power and Judgment: God hardened Pharaoh's heart so that Pharaoh would not let the Israelites go immediately. This allowed God to multiply His signs, wonders, and judgments on Egypt, demonstrating His supreme power over Pharaoh, Egypt’s gods, and the false powers at work. This divine hardening served to show God's glory through the plagues and eventual deliverance of Israel (Exodus 7:3-4, 9:12, 14:4).

​Pharaoh’s Own Stubbornness and Rebellion: Pharaoh was already a hardened, cruel ruler responsible for enslaving and oppressing Israel for centuries. Several passages indicate Pharaoh hardened his own heart as well, making him willfully resistant to God’s commands (Exodus 8:15, 8:32, 9:34). God's hardening confirmed and intensified Pharaoh's own self-chosen rebellion rather than overriding his free will.


To Fulfill God’s Sovereign Plan: God used Pharaoh as an instrument to carry out His plan to deliver His people. Pharaoh’s hardened heart served to fulfill God’s promises and demonstrated that God can bring salvation and judgment according to His divine will (Exodus 4:21, 7:3-4, Romans 9:18). It underscores God's ultimate authority over human history and His mercy on whom He wills.

SUMMARY:

God hardened Pharaoh's heart both because Pharaoh had already chosen to resist God, and as part of God's sovereign plan to bring about the liberation of Israel and display His power through the plagues. The hardening was not arbitrary but purposeful, revealing God's justice and glory through the unfolding events
